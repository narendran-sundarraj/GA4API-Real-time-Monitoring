# üìä GA4 Realtime Monitoring & Alerting Script

This script collects and processes **real-time and historical data** from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and stores it in **Google Sheets** for monitoring and optional alerting.

---

## üß© Script Overview

The script is organized into the following key functions:

| Function Name           | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `runKPIsReport()`      | Fetches real-time KPI events (last 30 minutes)                          |
| `runActiveUsersReport()` | Collects real-time active user & page view data                       |
| `runHourlyReport()`    | Fetches hourly event data for yesterday and today                       |
| `insertAndProcessData()` | Aggregates hourly GA4 data by brand/event/hour for analysis           |
| `compareMetrics()`     | Compares today's data vs yesterday's by hour and event                  |
| `sendAlerts()`         | Flags significant spikes/drops and (optionally) sends an alert email    |

## üìÅ Required Google Sheets Tabs

Make sure your spreadsheet contains the following tabs:

| Sheet Name              | Purpose                                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KPIs`                 | Stores real-time KPI events                                     |
| `Active Users`         | Stores active user metrics from GA4                             |
| `Hourly(Previous Period)` | Stores hourly historical GA4 data                           |
| `Metrics Alerts`       | Aggregated hourly data for comparison (auto-created if missing) |
| `Alerts Log`           | Output of hourly comparisons showing % differences              |
| `Alerts`               | Filtered list of significant anomalies for review/alerts        |

## üìç Google Sheet & Dashboard Links

These are embedded directly in the script and used in reports/emails:

- üîó **Google Sheet Report:**

- üìä **Looker Studio Dashboard:**

## üîî Alerting Logic (Optional)

### How It Works

- After aggregating and comparing hourly data, `sendAlerts()` scans for anomalies.
- It flags events where the percentage change is large **and** the volume is meaningful.

### Trigger Conditions

Alerts are triggered when:

- **Drop ‚â• 300%** ‚Üí `numDiff ‚â§ -3`
- **Spike ‚â• 500%** ‚Üí `numDiff ‚â• +5`

These use **"hundred-based percentage scaling"**, e.g.:

```text
-3  = -300%
+5  = +500%
```

Additionally:

- Both values (today and yesterday) must be ‚â• 10
- Alert entries are stored in the `Alerts` sheet

---

### üì© Email Notifications

Email alerts are **disabled by default**.

To enable:

1. Open the `sendAlerts()` function.
2. Find the following line:

```javascript
// GmailApp.sendEmail("your@email.com", "Metrics Alert", "", { htmlBody });
```

3. Replace the email and uncomment it:

```javascript
GmailApp.sendEmail("alerts@yourcompany.com", "Metrics Alert", "", { htmlBody });
```

4. Authorize Gmail access when prompted.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Notes

- The script is designed for **Google Apps Script** environment (bound to a Google Sheet).
- You can run each main function via a time-based trigger or manual execution.
- `sendAlerts()` is optional and currently **not live in production**.
- If your current production version doesn't include alerting, keep that as-is and run this in parallel or in a staging sheet.
